# Tracer v1.0 by Solistra
# ==============================================================================
# 
# Summary
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#   This script provides a simple, customizable tracer which can be used as a
# debugger or information-gathering tool for Ruby code. By default, the output
# from the tracer shows a visual representation of the Ruby call stack with
# relevant information. This is primarily a scripting and debugging tool.
# 
# Advanced Usage
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#   Essentially, this script is a wrapper around Ruby's 'Kernel.set_trace_func'
# method, which is a callback provided by the language when code is executed.
# This script has been written as a tracer and simple debugger, but has great
# potential to do much more than this. Your creativity and skill is the only
# real limit to the possibilities.
# 
#   'Kernel.set_trace_func' provides a great deal of information that can be
# used by both the conditional and tracer provided by this script. Ruby's tracer
# reports the *event* that was received ('c-call', 'c-return', 'call', 'return',
# 'class', 'end', 'line', and 'raise'); the *file* where the event occurred; the
# *line* within that file; the *method* (or *id*) executed; the *binding* of the
# method; and the *class* which it was executed in.
# 
#   Most of the information provided is largely self-explanatory, but the events
# may need a little elaboration:
# 
# - 'c-call' is given when a C routine has been called.
# - 'c-return', likewise, occurs when a C routine returns.
# - 'call' is when a Ruby method is called.
# - 'return' would be when a Ruby method returns.
# - 'class' marks the opening of a new Ruby class or module.
# - 'end' finishes a class or module definition.
# - 'line' is given when code is executed on a new line.
# - 'raise' is received when an Exception is raised.
