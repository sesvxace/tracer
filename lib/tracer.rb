# Tracer v1.5 by Solistra and Enelvon
# =============================================================================
# 
# Summary
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#   This script provides a simple, customizable tracer which can be used as a
# debugger or information-gathering tool for Ruby code. By default, the output
# from the tracer shows a visual representation of the Ruby call stack with
# relevant information. This is primarily a scripting and debugging tool.
# 
# Usage
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#   The tracer may be started either through a REPL or from a script call with
# the following:
# 
#     SES::Tracer.start
# 
#   You may also supply your own block of code for the tracer to run by simply
# passing a proc or lambda object as the argument (or running a block directly
# on the method):
# 
#     SES::Tracer.start do |event, file, line, id, binding, class_name|
#       file.gsub!(/^{\d+}/, $RGSS_SCRIPTS[$1.to_i][1]) if file =~ /^{(\d+)}/
#       printf("%8s %s:%-4d %20s %-20s\n", event, file, line, id, class_name)
#     end
# 
#   The tracer may be stopped through a REPL or from a script call with the
# following:
# 
#     SES::Tracer.stop
# 
#   You can also specify methods that will **always** invoke the tracer when
# run through the use of the `TRACE_METHODS` hash. Its keys are the names of
# classes and its values are symbols corresponding to methods within the class.
# By default it will cause `command_355` of `Game_Interpreter` to be traced.
# This is the "Script..." event command, which (without the help of the Tracer)
# will produce frustrating errors that point back to the `command_355` method
# itself. For example, to begin tracing when `Game_BattlerBase#change_hp` is
# called, we would do the following:
# 
#     TRACE_METHODS = {
#       Game_BattlerBase => [:change_hp],
#       Game_Interpreter => [:command_355],
#     }
# 
# Advanced Usage
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#   Essentially, this script is a wrapper around Ruby's `Kernel.set_trace_func`
# method, which is a callback provided by the language when code is executed.
# This script has been written as a tracer and simple debugger, but has great
# potential to do much more than this. Your creativity and skill are the only
# real limits to the possibilities.
# 
#   `Kernel.set_trace_func` provides a great deal of information that can be
# used by both the conditional and tracer provided by this script. Ruby's
# tracer reports the *event* that was received ('c-call', 'c-return', 'call',
# 'return', 'class', 'end', 'line', and 'raise'); the *file* where the event
# occurred; the *line* within that file; the *method* (or *id*) executed; the
# *binding* of the method; and the *class* which it was executed in.
# 
#   Most of the information provided is largely self-explanatory, but events
# may need a little elaboration:
# 
# - 'c-call' is given when a C routine has been called.
# - 'c-return', likewise, occurs when a C routine returns.
# - 'call' is when a Ruby method is called.
# - 'return' would be when a Ruby method returns.
# - 'class' marks the opening of a new Ruby class or module.
# - 'end' finishes a class or module definition.
# - 'line' is given when code is executed on a new line.
# - 'raise' is received when an Exception is raised.
